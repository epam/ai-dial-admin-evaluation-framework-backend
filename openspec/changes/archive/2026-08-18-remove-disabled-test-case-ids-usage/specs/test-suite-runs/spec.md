## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Trigger a test suite run
The service SHALL provide `POST /api/v1/test-suites/{testSuiteId}/runs` to create and trigger a new test suite run. The endpoint SHALL validate the request, verify the suite is bound to a dataset, persist a run record with status PENDING (including `testRunName` and `numberOfTestCases` snapshot), dispatch an async job, and return the run details immediately (without waiting for job completion). The unbound-suite guard (`datasetId IS NULL`) SHALL run before the `valid = false` check, so unbound suites SHALL surface as HTTP 409 with error code `SUITE_HAS_NO_DATASET` regardless of their validation state. An additional **run-time presence check** SHALL be performed after the `valid = false` guard: the service SHALL count the runnable test cases for the bound dataset — those that are valid and (when the suite has a `testCaseFilter`) match that filter — and if the count is zero, SHALL respond with HTTP 409 `INVALID_OPERATION` with message "Suite has no valid and enabled test cases". No run record SHALL be persisted and no async job SHALL be dispatched when this check fails. The count SHALL NOT consider any other exclusion source; `test_suites.disabled_test_case_ids` is not read.

Guard order:
1. Suite not found → 404 `NOT_FOUND`
2. Unbound (`datasetId == null`) → 409 `SUITE_HAS_NO_DATASET`
3. Config-invalid (`isValid == false`) → 409 `INVALID_OPERATION`
4. Zero runnable test cases → 409 `INVALID_OPERATION`
5. Concurrent run limits → 429 `TOO_MANY_REQUESTS`

Status: **Implemented**

#### Scenario: Successful run trigger
- **WHEN** client calls `POST /api/v1/test-suites/{testSuiteId}/runs` with a valid `RunConfigDto` body and the test suite exists and is bound to a dataset
- **THEN** system SHALL create a `test_suite_runs` record with status `PENDING`, populate `testRunName` (from config or auto-generated), snapshot `numberOfTestCases` from the bound dataset's runnable test case count (valid, and matching `testCaseFilter` when set), dispatch an async evaluation job on the dedicated executor, and return HTTP 202 Accepted with the `TestSuiteRunResponseDto`

#### Scenario: Test suite not found
- **WHEN** client calls `POST /api/v1/test-suites/{testSuiteId}/runs` with a non-existent `testSuiteId`
- **THEN** system SHALL respond with HTTP 404 and error code `NOT_FOUND`

#### Scenario: Unbound suite (datasetId is null) rejected
- **WHEN** client calls `POST /api/v1/test-suites/{testSuiteId}/runs` for an existing suite whose `datasetId IS NULL`
- **THEN** system SHALL respond with HTTP 409 and error code `SUITE_HAS_NO_DATASET`; no run record SHALL be persisted and no async job SHALL be dispatched; this check SHALL run before the `valid = false` guard so the dataset-binding failure mode is reported even when the suite would also fail validation

#### Scenario: Invalid run configuration
- **WHEN** client calls `POST /api/v1/test-suites/{testSuiteId}/runs` with an invalid body (e.g., `numberOfRuns` is null, zero, negative, or exceeds maximum)
- **THEN** system SHALL respond with HTTP 400 and error code `VALIDATION_ERROR`

#### Scenario: Global concurrent run limit exceeded
- **WHEN** client triggers a run but the total count of PENDING + RUNNING runs across all suites has reached the configured global limit
- **THEN** system SHALL respond with HTTP 429 Too Many Requests with error code `TOO_MANY_REQUESTS` and a message indicating the global limit was reached, including current and maximum counts in `details`

#### Scenario: Per-suite concurrent run limit exceeded
- **WHEN** client triggers a run but the count of PENDING + RUNNING runs for the target test suite has reached the configured per-suite limit
- **THEN** system SHALL respond with HTTP 429 Too Many Requests with error code `TOO_MANY_REQUESTS` and a message indicating the per-suite limit was reached, including current and maximum counts in `details`

#### Scenario: Test suite not in valid state
- **WHEN** client calls `POST /api/v1/test-suites/{testSuiteId}/runs` for a bound test suite that has `valid = false` (failed validation)
- **THEN** system SHALL respond with HTTP 409 Conflict and error code `INVALID_OPERATION` with a message indicating the test suite is not in a valid state (this check applies only to suites that pass the `SUITE_HAS_NO_DATASET` guard)

#### Scenario: Bound suite with no runnable test cases rejected
- **WHEN** client calls `POST /api/v1/test-suites/{testSuiteId}/runs` for a config-valid, bound suite whose dataset has zero runnable test cases — because none are valid, or none match the suite's `testCaseFilter`
- **THEN** system SHALL respond with HTTP 409 Conflict and error code `INVALID_OPERATION` with message "Suite has no valid and enabled test cases"; no run record SHALL be persisted and no async job SHALL be dispatched

#### Scenario: Runnable count honors testCaseFilter
- **WHEN** a config-valid, bound suite has valid test cases but its `testCaseFilter` matches a non-empty subset of them
- **THEN** the zero-runnable guard SHALL pass and the persisted `numberOfTestCases` SHALL equal the count of the filter-matching subset

#### Scenario: Runnable count ignores legacy stored exclusions
- **WHEN** a config-valid, bound suite carries a non-empty `test_suites.disabled_test_case_ids` value stored by an earlier version of the product
- **THEN** the runnable count and the persisted `numberOfTestCases` SHALL equal the number of valid, `testCaseFilter`-matching test cases in the dataset, as if the stored value were empty
- **AND** a `testCaseFilter` matching only test cases named in that stored value SHALL still produce a successful run (no 409)

#### Scenario: Executor rejects job submission
- **WHEN** the run is created successfully but the dedicated executor's queue is full and max pool size is reached at async dispatch time
- **THEN** the run SHALL have been persisted with status PENDING and HTTP 202 returned to the client. The service SHALL catch `RejectedExecutionException` in the post-commit callback, mark the run as FAILED with error category `RESOURCE_LIMIT` and code `EXECUTOR_REJECTED`, and log a warning

## Implementation notes
- The count is taken by `TestSuiteRunService.createRun` calling
  `service/domain/job/RunnableTestCaseSelector.countRunnable(datasetId, filterJson)` directly; the
  `RunnableTestCaseCounter` wrapper is deleted (its only remaining job was coalescing a null exclusion
  list).
- The message text "Suite has no valid and enabled test cases" is retained verbatim for client
  compatibility even though "enabled" no longer refers to a stored per-suite exclusion list.
